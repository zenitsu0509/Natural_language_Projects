NLP Projects Repository
=======================

This repository contains various NLP projects developed by **Himanshu Gangwar**. Each project showcases different aspects of Natural Language Processing, including sentiment analysis, language translation, and speech emotion recognition.

Projects Overview
-----------------

### 1\. **Movie Review Model**

-   **Description**: A sentiment analysis model trained on movie reviews. The goal is to classify whether a given movie review is positive or negative.
-   **Files**:
    -   `Movie_review_model.ipynb`
-   **Features**:
    -   Preprocessing of text data.
    -   Model training using popular ML algorithms like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or deep learning models.
    -   Evaluation of model accuracy and performance.

### 2\. **Sentiment Analyse**

-   **Description**: A basic sentiment analysis model that predicts the sentiment (positive/negative) of textual input.
-   **Files**:
    -   `Sentiment_analyse.ipynb`
-   **Features**:
    -   Data preprocessing and vectorization techniques.
    -   Uses popular NLP libraries such as NLTK or SpaCy.
    -   Output visualization with metrics like confusion matrix.

### 3\. **Sentiment Analysis Project**

-   **Description**: An extended sentiment analysis project with a focus on refining the preprocessing steps and implementing deep learning models like LSTM or BERT for improved accuracy.
-   **Files**:
    -   `Sentiment_analysis_project.ipynb`
-   **Features**:
    -   Advanced preprocessing (lemmatization, stemming, stopword removal).
    -   Implementation of RNN-based models and BERT for sentiment prediction.
    -   Model evaluation and analysis.

### 4\. **Speech Emotions Model**

-   **Description**: A model that recognizes emotions from speech data. It classifies audio input into different emotional states like happy, sad, angry, etc.
-   **Files**:
    -   `Speech_Emotions_Model.ipynb`
-   **Features**:
    -   Audio data preprocessing (MFCC extraction).
    -   Implementation using deep learning models (CNN, LSTM).
    -   Evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

### 5\. **End-to-Hindi Translation**

-   **Description**: A language translation model that translates English sentences to Hindi. The project uses sequence-to-sequence models or transformer models for translation tasks.
-   **Files**:
    -   `end_to_hindi.ipynb`
-   **Features**:
    -   Data preprocessing using tokenization.
    -   Implementation using seq2seq models with attention mechanisms.
    -   Performance evaluation using BLEU score.
